# The Setlist

You and your fellow players are going to talk on the role of members of a band who are due to go onstage very soon, probably in an hour or so.

The show is important and you are arguing about what should be on the set list. If you can't agree the show will be a disaster.

## Setup

1. Choose a musical genre that all players know well or can relate to, the band performs music in this genre
1. Name the band you are in
1. Each player in turn now chooses the instrument and role they have in the band, due to the complexities of lineups its okay to have two people in the same role but sort out how it works now
1. Again in turn name your character, describe their look in a sentence or a short paragraph, describe their instrument and gear. Try to imagine how they would look during their cover shoot in a music or style magazine.
1. As a group decide the nature of the show you are about to play and why it is significant. Describe the backstage area where the argument is happening.
1. Each player in turn chooses a rival for their character and their best friend (in the band); declare who the character is and the nature of the relationship, describe how this relationship started

## Play

Create the setlist: take a piece of paper and write "Setlist" at the top of the paper in marker.

There is no particular order to play but if in doubt the person with least songs on the setlist should go next

### Proposing a song

To propose a song simply declare its title and where in the setlist it should be played.

If no-one objects write it onto the setlist in pencil. Add your character's initials or name next to the track.

Any other player may ask the following questions:
1. "Why?" in which case you must explain why the song is important
1. "How does that go?" in which case you must describe the song

If during your description you need to refer to things that happened previously in the band or the other musicians frame a short scene (about five minutes) in which the other players play out your character's memory of events. After the scene each player may react with a one-sentence narrated scene explaining how the remembered event was from their perspective.

Anyone may object to the inclusion of the song. In which case there is a vote. If more than one person votes against the song then it is vetoed and a new song must be proposed.

The following rules apply to voting:

1. If your rival votes against your proposal you can ignore their vote
1. If any friends vote in opposite ways they must immediately consult and vote the same way or *fall out*

If the vote is successful then add the song to the set list as normal.

If your proposal is vetoed and you have not already used a flashback then you may frame a flashback scene. After the scene you can see if anyone changes their vote.

### Falling out

When friends fall out an previously unknown grievance, ideally relating to the song that has caused the falling out, must be revealed. Both former friends must accuse the other of being responsible for the grievance and they then become rivals.

All other players are allowed a short narration in response to the falling out and perhaps their memories of the event that has been raised.

## Endgame

When your time is up you need to get ready to go onstage.

Look at the setlist to determine how the gig goes.

If there are less than two songs per player the gig is underwhelming. The opportunity of the gig is lost but the band stands together.

If one character has proposed a quarter or more of the songs (trios: one half or more, quartets, one-third or more) then the band is resentful and collectively sabotages the whole set. Each player in turn describes how their character undermines the performance. The player of the character who proposed the majority of the songs can decide to storm off-stage and narrates their exit; alternatively they can confront the rest of the band on-stage, narrate how that goes similarly.

The group must decide whether they stay together or not and whether the opportunity is lost or not.

Otherwise the gig is a success, the whole group collectively narrates their walk on stage and the crowd's enthusiastic reception. Cut away before the first note is played.

### Optional: walk the setlist

The group collectively narrate going on stage, the atmosphere is expectant but muted.

Go through the setlist, for each song the proposer may make an introduction and then the group collectively narrates starting the song.

At this point the proposer must ask their rivals whether the song goes well. If the majority (more than half) of rivals say yes then the song is a success, collectively narrate the end of the song and the great reception it gets from the crowd. If the majority answer was no then the proposer gets to narrate the song's close and the indifferent or silent reception it receives.

If the song went well put a tick next to it on the set list. Otherwise put a cross next to it.

Before the final song total up the the number of ticks and crosses. If the crosses outnumber the ticks the gig has gone badly, any member of the band can choose to bail before the final number.

For the final number each player with a character on-stage narrates what they character plays and what they are thinking about in the face of an indifferent or hostile crowd.

If the ticks outnumber the crosses its time for the big band finale, collectively narrate the performance of the final number, each character should interact with their best friend during the song. At the end of the song rivals may choose to forgive one another, if there are no rivalries at the end of the set the band takes a collective bow as the audience goes wild.
